## ðŸ“šProcess
First I am Developed Major Screens of Netflix app Using Flutter framework and Dart Programming.

In the development of my Flutter application, I adhered to the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture. DDD emphasizes the alignment of software design with the domain model, enabling a deeper understanding and representation of the problem domain. By organizing the application's structure around core domain concepts, such as entities, value objects, and domain services, DDD promotes a clear and cohesive architecture.

I utilized the TMDB database API to seamlessly integrate  functionality into my Flutter project, enabling dynamic retrieval of movie posters, titles, and descriptions.

Flutter's BLoC (Business Logic Component) state management pattern is utilized in this project for efficient handling of application states. BLoC facilitates separation of concerns by isolating business logic from UI components, thereby promoting scalability and maintainability. With BLoC, data streams are managed through streams and sinks, enabling seamless integration of asynchronous operations.
